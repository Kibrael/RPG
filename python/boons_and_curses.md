### Boons and Curses Overview
Boons represent a character's influence over the setting and story and are frequently positive. 

Curses represent the setting or story's influence over a character, often with negative impacts.



### Boon Pool Composition
Deck refresh rate, hand size, draw amount, boon effectiveness are all modified by the luck stat.
Some boons are only available with access to more than one skill.
boons are tiered, after choosing a boon it becomes more powerful when the attribute or skill it comes from is advanced.

### Curse Pool Composition
Curses are added to the Curse Pool
- Run by game master?
- Require use of curses by players?
- Mix curses into boon deck when drawing? Require playing of curses before hand refresh? IE cannot refresh hand if curses present?

### Using Boons
When not in combat, you have access to all your characters boons that have not been burned since your character's last boon refresh.

You may choose a boon from your available pool as part of your action. This boon does need to match the action. 
- If the boon does have modifiers to an action, those apply. 

**Resolution**
`Boons` and `Curses` resolve on a first in first out stack.
Boons are played after dice are rolled (if desired)

Boons are represented by a deck of cards showing each boon a character has available for use.

### Boon Refresh
Boons refresh at intervals set by the game master. 
Typically this is after resting (daily allottment) or after combat (catching your breath). Every system of refresh will have a different feel.
The more frequent the refresh the more heroic the game will feel. The longer the time between, the grittier the game will feel. 
Longer refresh intervals are likely to cause a heavier `Curse` usage.  

Boons can also be refreshed by burning a `Luck` point. This causes one damage to your character's `Luck` attribute which may be healed by normal means.
- Burning a `Luck` point also allows a fresh boon hand?

Boon refresh events and powers
- boon to refresh boons?
- intentional break points players can use to refresh?
- hard set game type events?
- done by story?

### Acquiring Boons and Curses

**Acquiring Boons**
Boons are granted from exceptional Attribute scores, training in skills, interaction with powerful forces, or purchased as part of character advancement.

Boons granted from an Attribute have effects that relate to that attribute. These boons are chosen from a list linked to the specific attribute.

Boons granted from skill development have effects that relate to that skill. These boons are chosen from a list linked to the specific skill. General skill boons may also be chosen.

Boons granted from interacting with powers of the setting may be chosen by the player or the game master as the situation dictates. 
These boons are often limited in their use (number of times, duration of availability, great cost for using the boon, etc).
