### Combat Overview
Combat, like other skill use, tests a player against an opponent. The opponent could be active or passive. The main distinction


### Armor Effects and Modifiers
Armor mitigates damage received. This mitigation is a passive effect and requires no action or skill use by the wearer. 

*Note: See active armor use for non-passive armor benefits.*


**Armor Types**

Armor types are composed from two factors: material and style.
- Material has the subtypes `hard` and `soft`
- Style has the subtypes `rigid` and `flexible`

**Armor Type List**
- `HR`: hard material and rigid style, examples include: plate, chitin, wood.
- `HF`: hard material and flexible style, examples include: chain, lamelar, scale.
- `SR`: soft material and rigid style, examples include: boiled leather, laminated layers of cloth (or other), studded leather, banded mail.
- `SF`: soft material and flexible style, examples include: padded gambesons, soft leather, hide.

**Armor Statuses**
**Armor Status Modifiers**
**Effects on Mobility**

**Effects on Damage and Statuses**
Armor grants reductions to damage type based on the quality of the armor and the relationship to weapon damage type.
Armor also grants resistance to status effects based on quality and relationship to type and cause of the status.

### Weapons Effects and Modifiers

Weapons do additional damage to unarmored opponents.?
  
**Weapon Damage Types**

Weapons have one or more damage types that they inflict. 
The three primary damage types for weapons are: Slashing, Bludgeoning, and Piercing. 

**Weapon Statuses**
- bleeding: tiers
- stunned
- unconscious
- crippled
- slowed
- no movement
- staggered, off balance
- broken bone
- 

Statuses inflicted or cured relate to weapon damage types, boon effects, skills

### Armor Vs Weapon Types Diagrams
The diagrams below show how weapon damage types interact with armor types. The colors on the diagrams indicate the following:
- **Blue** areas indicate bonuses to defense, often in the form of damage reduction
- **Orange** areas are decreased defense, resulting in increased damage or status effects. These are rare.
- **Grey** areas indicate no modifiers from the armor and weapon type interaction.

### Brainstorming Options
Stylistic Options:
- Shadow Run style initiative with repeat actions
- Attacks by professions, actions standard (dnd)

Tension point:
- higher skill better effect
- sometimes better effect is more frequent actions
    - IE attacking many things vs 1 thing really hard
How will boons and curses affect speed and number of actions?
- special actions possible
- surges: extra actions
- convert actions to bonuses
- 
How will boons and curses affect dice mechanics, automatic success, and automatic failure of combat?
- boosts rolls: attack, defense, damage, resistance, luck
- boost to distance of movement
- automatic success
- automatic failure
- boost to status
- health regeneration
- status stabilization
- rerolls
    - 
fatigue checks: check difficulty increases with each additional action taken in a round. penalty is severe, discarding some/all boons?

unlock combat maneuvers and special attacks through combinations of boons and skills, multiple skills, multiple skills and boons, multiple boons. If an ability is unlocked with 
boon or curse prerequisites then it must be powered with boon or curse cards.
