### Attributes

Attributes are numerical representations of a character's makeup. Higher scores in attributes indicate aptitude for using associated skills and characteristics.

As attributes increase boons are gained and dice pools improve, granting a character better chances of success in tests of skill, resistance, etc.

Boons gained from high attributes have powers relating to that attribute. 
For example, a Martial boon will grant power related to combat or strategy while a Social boon grants power related to interactions with others.

Conversely, low scores on attributes bestow curses and reduce the quality of dice pools. 
Low dice pools will reduce chances of success on tests. Curses are added to the game master curse deck which is used for NPC and Villain boons.


Each attribute governs a set of related skills and is used to determine the dice pool used for tests of those skills. 
In some cases multiple attributes may be averaged for skill rolls.  
The attribute or attributes governing a skill determine which dice to roll when performing tests of that skill.


**Attribute Theory:**
Continuing the implementation of `less is more` some attributes that are split in other games have been combined. 
This has two effects:
1) It simplifies gameplay, which is especially important for new players (and experienced players make new rules anyway).
2) It allows a focus on attributes and skills that are specific to the setting or enhance the setting's mood.

The loss of specificity in attributes, such as agility versus strenght, is mitigated by the boon system. 
A player's choice, and use of, boons will influence how their character performs in the game and how they are perceived by players and NPCs.


### Initial Attributes:

**Physique:**   
Strength, agility, fortitude, stamina. 
Physique is the attribute related to a character's physical prowess.  
Physique determines a character's physical survivability, resistance to physical status effects, combat ability, and other aspects of athleticism.  

**Mental:**  
Focus, intelligence, memory, knowledge.  
Mental is the attribute related to a character's mind and intellectual ability.
Mental determines a character's mental survivability, resistance to mental status effects, mental and magical combat ability, capacity for knowledge  
and other aspects of intellectualism.

**Social:**  
Persuasion, charisma, likability, emotional intelligence.  
Social is the attribute related to a character's aptitude for interaction with others.

**Sei√∞r (seidhr, seidh, seidr, seithr, seith, or seid):**  
Ritual, sorcery, alchemy, wundermachen.  
Seidr is the attribute related to a character's ability to manipulate, shape, and use the latent energy present in the world.
Seidr determines a character's ability to use sorcerous powers, craft wunders, and imbue ritual objects with power.

**Wyrd:**  
Intuition, destiny, veritas, luck.  
Wyrd is the attribute governing a character's unformed ability to influence the story.
Wyrd determines a character's ability to influence the world that is not outlined in the other attributes.
Wyrd determines boon hand size during combat and can be used to influence dice rolls.

use boons to specialize in attribute focus:
	- IE physique boon for auto win speed test vs resist damage

### Attribute Boons and Curses**

**Physique**
Damage Resistant roll martial dice to reduce damage once


**Mental**


**Social**


**Luck**
Spend a luck point to add 1 to a roll. Can only be used once per roll. Simulates the "almost didn't make it" effect.
Luck is the remainder attribute. After other attributes are chosen, the remaining points are put into the Luck attribute.
Luck represents the unfocused force of destiny and legend on the character. Higher luck gives stronger influence on destiny.
If players are rolling for stats, the highest player's attribute total is used for determining Luck remainder points for all characters.
