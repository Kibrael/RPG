### Attributes

Attributes are numerical representations of a character's makeup. Higher scores in attributes indicate aptitude for using associated skills and characteristics.

As attributes increase boons are gained and dice pools improve, granting a character better chances of success in tests of skill, resistance, etc.

Boons gained from high attributes have powers relating to that attribute. 
For example, a Martial boon will grant power related to combat or strategy while a Social boon grants power related to interactions with others.

Conversely, low scores on attributes bestow curses and reduce the quality of dice pools. 
Low dice pools will reduce chances of success on tests. Curses are added to the game master curse deck which is used for NPC and Villain boons.


Each attribute governs a set of skills. 
In some cases multiple attributes may be averaged to for skill rolls.  
The attribute or attributes governing a skill determine which dice to roll when performing tests of that skill.


Attributes grant a boon at each point above normal that does not have a dice pool change.  
Attributes give a curse at each point below normal that does not have a dice pool change.
