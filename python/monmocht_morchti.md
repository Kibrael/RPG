A setting attribute representing the degree of corruption by the Monmocht Morchti. This can bring powers, but always brings curses and the manipulation of the power of belief to serve the Monmocht Morchti.

Increases to this attribute happen during play. Decreases may be possible depending on context, but are extremely rare.

Higher corruption unlocks more powerful boons.
