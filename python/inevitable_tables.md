### Table Overview
A roll on an inevitable table costs 1 Inevitable point. This point is permanently lost.
Inevitable points can be gained through story events.

The use of an inevitable point to roll on an inevitable table represents the manifestation of amorphous potential story shaping energy into a story element.
*Note: This is true whether the point is spent on a table roll or to influence a scene (see [Spending Inevitable Points]()).*
