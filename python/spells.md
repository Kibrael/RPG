### Spells
Spells are gained as skills, though they may have special requirements such as membership to an organization.

Collecting a full arsenal of spells is time consuming and difficult. Characters specializing in Seidr will face many trade-offs in their quest for power.
They will likely be limited in their breadth and depth of skills compared to other characters or could have lower attributes and survivability.
However the tradeoffs are made, investment in spell skills ruled by Seidr will provide advantages and limitations.
see [seidr]() section of the skills page.

Spells are rituals that have been standardized and recorded. The appearance, implements, ingredients, etc can be referenced and recognized.
- Recognized spells can show others which organizations a character is allied with. Beware tipping your hand to enemies.

Accessing or learning the spells of an organization frequently requires membership loyalty or the exchange of significant favors.
Spells curated and known by an organization have strong thematic components. 
Research along specific lines is often fostered by an organization and specialization is self reinforcing, resulting in deep specialties.
Utility magics have been traded between sects and because of this some spells have become available outside their original originization. 
These spells are typically not exceptionally powerful but represent the types of magical utility that most practitioners need to survive or prosper.
- IE basic wards, mental protections
