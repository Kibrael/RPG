### Spells
Spells are gained as skills, though they may have special requirements such as membership to an organization.

Collecting a full arsenal of spells is time consuming and difficult. Characters specializing in Seidr will face many trade-offs in their quest for power.
They will likely be limited in their breadth and depth of skills compared to other characters or could have lower attributes and survivability.
However the tradeoffs are made, investment in spell skills ruled by Seidr will provide advantages and limitations.
